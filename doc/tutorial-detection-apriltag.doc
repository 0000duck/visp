\section intro_apriltag Introduction

This tutorial shows how to detect one or more AprilTag patterns with ViSP. To this end we provide vpDetectorAprilTag class that is a wrapper over <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html">Apriltag</a> 3rd party library. Notice that there is no need to install this 3rd party, since AprilTag source code is embedded in ViSP. 

The vpDetectorAprilTag class inherits from vpDetectorBase class, a generic class dedicated to detection. For each detected tag, it allows to retrieve some characteristics such as the tag id, and in the image the polygon that contains the tag and corresponds to its 4 corner coordinates, the bounding box or the center of gravity of the tag.

Moreover vpDetectorAprilTag class allows to estimate the 3D pose of the tag. To this end camera parameters as well as the size of the tag are required.

In the next sections you will find examples that show how to detect tags in a single image and or in images acquired from a camera connected to your computer.

Note that all the material (source code and image) described in this tutorial is part of ViSP source code and could be downloaded using the following command:

\code
$ svn export https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git/trunk/tutorial/detection/tag
\endcode

\section apriltag_detection_basic AprilTag detection and pose estimation (single image)

The following example also available in tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp allows to detect a tag on a single image. 

\include tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp

The default behavior is to detect <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html">h36h11</a> patterns in \c AprilTag.pgm image, but \c -—tag_family \<family\> option allows to consider other patterns. To see which are the options, just run:
\code
$ ./tutorial-apriltag-detector —help
\endcode

To detect multiple h36h11 patterns in the image \c AprilTag.pgm that is provided just run:
\code
$ ./tutorial-apriltag-detector
\endcode
You will get the following result:

\image html img-apriltag-image.png

After a user click in the image, you will get the following image where the frames correspond to the 3D pose of each tag. 
\image html img-apriltag-pose.png

Now we explain the main lines of the source.

First we have to include the header corresponding to vpDetectorAprilTag class that allow to detect one or multiple tags.
\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Include

Then in the \c main() function before going further we need to check if ViSP was built with AprilTag 3rd party. We also check if ViSP is able to display images using either X11, or the Graphical Device Interface (GDI) under Windows, or OpenCV. 

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Macro defined

After reading the input image \c AprilTag.pgm and creation of a display device in order to visualize the image, since vpDetectorAprilTag class inherits from vpDetectorBase we are able to construct the requested detector.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Create base detector

Then we are applying some settings. There is especially vpDetectorAprilTag::setAprilTagQuadDecimate() function that could be used to decimate the input image in order to speed up detection.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp AprilTag detector settings
 
We are now ready to detect any 36h11 tag in the image. There is the vpDetectorAprilTag::detect(const vpImage<unsigned char> &) function that allows to simply detect any tags in the image, but since here we want also to estimate the 3D pose of the tags, we call rather vpDetectorAprilTag::detect(const vpImage<unsigned char> &, const double, const vpCameraParameters &, std::vector<vpHomogeneousMatrix> &) that returns the pose of each tag as a vector of vpHomogeneousMatrix in \c cMo_vec var.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Detect and compute pose

If one or more tags are detected we can retrieve the number of detected tags in order to create a for loop over the tags.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Parse detected codes

For each tag, we can then get the location of the 4 points that define the polygon that contains the code and the corresponding bounding box.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Get location

And finally, we are also able to get the tag id calling vpDetectorAprilTag::getMessage().

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Get message

Next in the code we display the 3D pose of each tag as a RGB frame. 

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector.cpp Display camera pose for each tag

\section apriltag_detection_live AprilTag detection and pose estimation (live camera)

This other example also available in tutorial-apriltag-detector-live.cpp shows how to couple the AprilTag detector to an image grabber in order to detect tags on each new image acquired by a camera connected to your computer.

\include tutorial-apriltag-detector-live.cpp

The usage of this example is similar to the previous one:
- with option \c —tag_family you select the kind of tag that you want to detect.
- if more than one camera is connected to you computer, with option \c —-input you can select which camera to use. The first camera that is found has number 0.

To detect 36h11 tags on images acquired by a second camera connected to your computer use:
\code
$ ./tutorial-apriltag-detector-live --tag_family 0 —input 1
\endcode

The source code of this example is very similar to the previous one except that here we use camera framegrabber devices (see \ref tutorial-grabber). Two different grabber may be used:
- If ViSP was build with Video For Linux (V4L2) support available for example on Fedora or Ubuntu distribution, VISP_HAVE_V4L2 macro is defined. In that case, images coming from an USB camera are acquired using vpV4l2Grabber class. 
- If ViSP wasn't build with V4L2 support but with OpenCV, we use cv::VideoCapture class to grab the images. Notice that when images are acquired with OpenCV there is an additional conversion from cv::Mat to vpImage.

\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector-live.cpp Construct grabber

Then in the while loop, at each iteration we acquire a new image
\snippet tutorial-apriltag-detector-live.cpp Acquisition

This new image is then given as input to the AprilTag detector.

You are now ready to see the \ref tutorial-detection-barcode, that illustrates how to detect QR codes in an image.
