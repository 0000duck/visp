\page tutorial-install-iOS Tutorial: Installation from source on iOS devices
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to build ViSP framework from source on OSX in order to use it for iOS developments. These steps have been tested on OSX 10.11.45 with CMake 3.5.2, Xcode 7.3.1 and Python 2.7.10.

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_iOS_required Install required software

- CMake gui 2.8 for OSX or higher that could be download at : http://www.cmake.org
- Xcode
- Python 2.7 (not tested with Python 3)

\note For the moment, we are not able to build ViSP iOS framework with optional 3rd parties libraries/frameworks such as OpenCV.

\section install_iOS_get_source Getting ViSP source code

\note The folowing steps are only working with ViSP 3.0.1 or higher.

There are different ways to get ViSP source code compatible with iOS:

- You can get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the following command
\code
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz
\endcode

- Or you can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz 
\endcode
or
\code
unzip visp-x.y.z.zip
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted \c \<workspace_dir\>/visp.

\section install_iOS_build Building ViSP framework

- Enter in the \c \<workspace_dir\> and check the name of he folder containing ViSP source code
\code
$ cd ~/<workspace_dir>
$ ls
visp
\endcode

- Build ViSP framework
\code
$ python visp/platforms/ios/build_framework.py ios
\endcode

Once build, you will get ``~/<workspace_dir>/ios/visp3.framework`` that could be added to your Xcode projects.
