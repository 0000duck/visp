Building ViSP with CMake
------------------------

Prerequsits: 
(1) Install newest cmake version (minimum 2.2.3) from http://www.cmake.org
    Under Windows, it is preferable to install the CVS version of CMake 
(2) checkout/install ViSP source code.

(3) configure 
run cmake to change options and to generate makefiles. 

example for a build on Linux:
cd to source directory of ViSP
> cd ViSP
To configure and generate makefiles:

On Linux:
> ccmake . (mind the 'dot')
See the bottom line for usage instructions, in particular:
- press 'c', then modify options as required and press 'c' again to configure
- finally press 'g' to generate Makefiles

On Win32:
> CMakeSetup.exe 
The GUI is self-explaining.

Note:
You can also use 
 > cmake .
directly if you prefer command line instead of graphical interface.


(4) compile:
> make

(5) install:
> make install
Copy headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/visp
Copy library in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib
Copy visp-config shell script in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

(6) uninstall:
> make uninstall
Dual from install.
Remove headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/visp
Remove library and cmake files in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib 
Remove visp-config shell script in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

(7) clean:
> make clean
