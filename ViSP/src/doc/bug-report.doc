If you find a bug in the ViSP software, we appreciate that you inform us in
order that we can fix it.

Before reporting a bug, please check the <a href=faq.html>FAQ</a> and <a href=platform-notes.html>Platform Notes</a> on our web site to check if the problem has already been addressed. 

Please, include the following information in your bug report: 
-  The name and version number of your compiler 
-  The name and version number of your operating system 
-  The version of the ViSP software you are using, and what configure options it was compiled with. 

If the problem you are reporting is only visible during run-time, try to create
a small test program that exhibits the problem when run. Often, such a program
can be made by simply introducing some minor changes to one of the examples
provided in the ViSP examples directory.

Please send the bug report to <a mailto=visp@irisa.fr>visp@irisa.fr</a>.
