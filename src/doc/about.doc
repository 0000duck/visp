<h2>Introduction</h2>

ViSP is a modular software that allows fast development of visual servoing
applications. Visual servoing consists in specifying a task as the regulation
of a set of visual features.  Various issues have thus to be considered in the
design of such applications: among these issues we find the control of robots
motions, the modeling of the visual features, and the tracking of the visual
measurements.  Our environment features a wide class of control skills as well
as a library of real-time tracking processes and a simulation toolkit..


ViSP is released in different versions: 

<b>ViSP Free Edition</b> is the version of ViSP available for
development of Free and Open Source software only (no commercial use). It is
provided free of charge under the terms of the <a href=license.html>Q Public
License</a>. It includes the source code and makefiles for Linux, Solaris,
SunOS, and Irix. The latest version is available for 
<a href=download.html>download</a>.
	
<b>ViSP Professional Edition</b> provided for commercial software
development. This version also supports Windows 95 and NT. It permits
traditional commercial software distribution and includes free upgrades and
Technical Support Service. For questions regarding purchase and pricing

<h2>ViSP authors</h2>

ViSP was developed at <a href=http://www.irisa.fr/accueil/index_uk.htm>Irisa/INRIA Rennes</a> by the
<a href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html>Lagadic team</a>.

The ViSP authors are <a href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/Eric.Marchand-eng.html>Eric Marchand</a>, <a href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/Fabien.Spindler-eng.html>Fabien Spindler</a> and <a href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/Francois.Chaumette-eng.html>Francois.Chaumette</a>. The ViSP contributors are Andrew Comport, Nicolas Mansard, Anne-Sophie Tranchant... 

This software was initially developed by <a
href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/team/Eric.Marchand-eng.html>Eric
Marchand</a>. Then, it was optimized and extended by the contribution of the
other authors.

<h2>ViSP supported platforms</h2>

The ViSP (Free and Professional Editions) library runs on Unix (Linux,
SunOS, Solaris and Irix) operating systems.  Currently we actively support the
following combinations of operating systems and compilers, where g++ can be
either egcs 2.91.x, g++ 2.8.x, g++ 2.95.x, g++ 2.96, g++ 3.0.4, g++-3.1,
g++-3.2.x, g++-3.3.x or g++-3.4.x and where CC can be either CC-5.x or
CC-7.3.x.

Moreover, the ViSP Professional Edition library runs on Windows 95/98/ME,
Windows NT 4, Windows 2000 and Windows XP. ViSP/Windows can be used with
Cygwin g++ 2.95.x or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. In that case, the distribution
includes project files for Microsoft Visual C++ (.dsp files).
