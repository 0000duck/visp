<h2>Irisa Presentation</h2>

<a href=http://www.irisa.fr/accueil/index_uk.htm>Irisa</a> is a publicly funded research laboratory including full-time research scientists or teaching research scientists and postgraduate students. <a href=http://www.inria.fr/index.en.html>INRIA</a>, the <a href=http://www.cnrs.fr/index.html>CNRS</a>, the <a href=http://www.univ-rennes1.fr>University of Rennes 1</a> and <a href=http://www.insa-rennes.fr>INSA Rennes</a> are all partners in this joint research unit.

Irisa involves twenty-six research teams centered around four major scientific
topics:
- networks and systems
- software engineering and symbolic computation 
- man-machine interaction, images, data, knowledge 
- simulation and optimization of complex systems. 

These generic themes find their application in many fields, resulting in
interdisciplinary cooperation with other leading professionals from both the
academic and the industrial world, in areas such as telecommunications,
multimedia, transport, genome science, emerging technologies applied to health,
environment etc.


<h2>Lagadic team presentation</h2>

Research activities of the <a
href=http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/welcome-eng.html>Lagadic</a> team are
concerned with visual servoing and active vision.  Visual servoing consists in
using the information provided by a vision sensor to control the movements of a
dynamic system, this system which can be real within the framework of robotics,
or virtual within the framework of computer animation or augmented reality.
This research topic is at the intersection of the fields of robotics, automatic
control, and computer vision.  These fields are the subject of profitable
research since many years and are particularly interesting by their very broad
scientific and application spectrum.  Within this spectrum, we focus ourselves
on the interaction between visual perception and action.  This topic is
significant because it provides an alternative to the traditional
Perception-Decision-Action cycle.  It is indeed possible to link more closely
the perception and action aspects, by directly integrating the measurements
provided by a vision sensor in closed loop control laws.

This set of themes of visual servoing is the central scientific topic of
the Lagadic group.  More generally, our objective is to design strategies
of coupling perception and action from images for applications in robotics,
computer vision, virtual reality and augmented reality.

This objective is significant, first of all because of the variety and the
great number of the potential applications to which can lead our work.  It
is also significant to be able to raise the scientific aspects associated
with these
problems, namely modeling of visual features representing in an optimal way
the interaction between action and perception, taking into account of
complex environments and the specification of high level tasks.  We also
work to treat new problems provided by imagery systems such those resulting
from an omnidirectional vision sensor or echographic probes.  We are finlly
interested in revisiting traditional problems in computer vision
(3D~localization, structure and motion) through the visual servoing approach.
